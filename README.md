    <P>
         <big>The block Crusade is an indigenous pious society whose aim is to propagate the message of Fatima message in 1917.
         </P>
         The Block Rosary Crusade is a society formed by our Lady through the three little seers, namely <b> Fransisco Marto, 8 years and Jacinta Marto,
        <Section>
            7 years and Lucia Dos Santos</b>the eldest amongst the three, <b>10 years old</b>
        </Section>
        <section>
         
            <p>

            It is not just a society but a Crusade fighting against evil and sin by fulfilling the four conditions of Fatima, which are:
            </p>
            <section>
                
                <p>
                    1. The daily recietation of the holy Rosary
                    <p>
                        2. Daily sacrifices for sinners
                        <p>
                            3.Communion of reparation on the first Saturday of every month
                            <p>
                             4. Consecration to the immaculate heart of Mary
                            </p>
                        </p>
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    These mark out a Block Rosary Crusader from every other person and make it hard for a lot of people to actually join

                </p>
                <section>
                    the Crusade. They prefer to label it a "children's society" instead of accepting their inability to devotedly fulfill the five conditions mentioned above.</big>
            
    <p>
       <big>It is a Catholic lay apostolic organization and pious devotional association. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As a group that has the apostolic blessing of the church, the Block Rosary Crusade of Nigeria is one of the societies in the Catholic Church  
    </p>
<p>
    who took it as a point of duty to propagate this message  of Fatima. Hence she gathers children, youth, Adult and teaches them to receite the Rosary everyday,
</p>
<p>
    thereby fulfilling the biblical message. "YES FROM NOW ONWARD ALL GENERATIONS WILL CALL ME BLESSED" (Lk 11:48)
</p>
<p>
    She encourages family to pray the Rosary everyday, not only for their own intentions but for the intentions of the whole world.
</p>
<p>
    The Block Rosary Crusade holds their prayes in the streets, in the homes of the believers and in the Church premises.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, different locations traditionally reffered to as Centers are established to promote the neighborhood Rosary prayer.
</p>
<section>
    Normally, these Centres are believed to be under the supervision of the parishes depending on their locations and boundaries.</big>
